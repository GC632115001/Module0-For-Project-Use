While achieving this goal, we strive to make new discoveries in machine learning to support to multidisciplinary innovation.         ACHIEVEMENTS       4  Research Area  .       23  Researchers  .       3  Collaboration  .       5  Fundraiser  .            RESEARCH AREAS       Health informatics  In our Lab, Medical research is the process of studying different factors in human health and finding solutions for challenges in healthcare, MRI, X-ray were analyzed to find some significant issues and tests are just some of the diagnostic tools available to help detect certain injuries and diseases.       Mobile App  Healthcare mobile application development is one of our mission for  building an app for mobile devices to help its users successfully submit and follow their health issues in real-time.\n\nWe focused on application development, application content, UX UI.       Internet of Things  Our research in the IoT enables healthcare professionals to be more watchful and connect with the patients proactively. Data collected from IoT devices can help physicians identify the best treatment process for patients and reach the expected outcomes.       Life Science  Our research in the life sciences comprises the branches of science that involve the scientific study of life, includes engineering, knowledge management and innovation designs.
